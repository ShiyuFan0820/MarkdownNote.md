# MarkdownNote

## Separate lines/paragraphs

If you want to separate old paragraph from new one,you should put an empty line between them.  

If you want them to be in the same paragraph but in a new line,you can put two spaces between them.

## Headings

Precede headings with ‘#’ and a space，put one pound symbol means the largest heading,for every pound symbol added,the headings are going to get smaller and smaller.

Six pound symbol is the smallest headling.

## Bold/Italic

Bold:Surrounding the texts which you want them to be bold with double asterisks '**' or double underscores '__' on the two sides.

Italic:Surrounding the texts which you want them to be italic with one asterisk '*' or one underscore '_' on the two sides.

Both bold and italic should surround the text with three asterisks '***' or underscores '___' on the two sides.

## Strikethrough/Highlight

When want to cross texts off,just surrond the texts with double tildes '~~' on the both sides(But I have tried just one tilde and that also did well in Github).

When want to highlight some texts,use double equal signs '=='(Github is not supportive)

## Supercript/Subscript

Supercripted texts can use the sup tags at both sides of the texts.(But I have tried just one sup tag and that also did well in Github)

## Code Blocks

When you want something to be represented as code,you can surround it by backtick "`".

If you want to have code across multiple lines,you can type triple backticks at the beginning and the end of the texts.Add "js" after the backticks on the first line means the language of the code is Javascript,"py" means the language of the code is Python.

## Links

Put links in squre brackets to create a link to go somewhere.

## Blockquotes

Put the angle bracket in front of the texts to create the blockquotes,you can put as many angle bracket as you want to nest the texts.

## Horizontal Rule

If you want put a line between two texts,you can put three dashes or three underscores or three asterisks,but always make sure there is empty linee between all the elements.

## Lists

If you want to type a list,you can use number and a period after that and a space followed by the list items.It does not matter what the number is.

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3

If you do not want the number list,you can exchange the number with "*","-",or "+".

- Item 1
- Item 2 
- Item 3

If you want to nest the list you can type the "ENTER",then put a "TAB" key or four spaces before the texts.

- Item 1
  - Item 2
    - Item 3
