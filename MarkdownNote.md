# MarkdownNote
## Separate lines/paragraphs
If you want to separate old paragraph from new one,you should put an empty line between them.  

If you want them to be in the same paragraph but in a new line,you can put two spaces between them.
## Headings
Precede headings with ‘#’，put one pound symbol means the largest heading,for every pound symbol added,the headings are going to get smaller and smaller.

Six pound symbol is the smallest headling.
