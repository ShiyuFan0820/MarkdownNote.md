# MarkdownNote

## Separate lines/paragraphs

If you want to separate old paragraph from new one,you should put an empty line between them.  

If you want them to be in the same paragraph but in a new line,you can put two spaces between them.

## Headings

Precede headings with ‘#’ and a space，put one pound symbol means the largest heading,for every pound symbol added,the headings are going to get smaller and smaller.

Six pound symbol is the smallest headling.

## Bold/Italic

**Bold**

Surrounding the texts which you want them to be bold with double asterisks '**' or double underscores '__' on the two sides.

**Italic**

Surrounding the texts which you want them to be italic with one asterisk '*' or one underscore '_' on the two sides.

Both bold and italic should surround the text with three asterisks '***' or underscores '___' on the two sides.

## Strikethrough/Highlight

**Strikethrough**

When want to cross texts off,just surrond the texts with double tildes '~~' on the both sides(But I have tried just one tilde and that also did well in Github).

For example:

~Strikethrough~

**Highlight**

When want to highlight some texts,use backtick '`' at both sides of the text.

For example:

![](https://github.com/ShiyuFan0820/MarkdownNote.md/assets/149340606/1b67be82-95f5-42a5-881b-2b19134e1741)

`Highlight`

## Supercript/Subscript

Supercripted texts can use the sup tags at both sides of the texts.(But I have tried just one sup tag and that also did well in Github)

For example:

## Code Blocks

When you want something to be represented as code,you can surround it by backtick "`".

If you want to have code across multiple lines,you can type triple backticks at the beginning and the end of the texts.

Add "js" after the backticks on the first line means the language of the code is Javascript,"py" means the language of the code is Python.

## Links

Put links in square brackets to create a link to go somewhere,if you want to add some descriptions to represent the link words,you can put the descriptions in the square brackets and put the link in a "()" after it.

For example:

## Blockquotes

Put the angle bracket in front of the texts to create the blockquotes,you can put as many angle bracket as you want to nest the texts.
>abcd
>
>abcd

## Horizontal Rule

If you want put a line between two texts,you can put three dashes or three underscores or three asterisks,but always make sure there is empty linee between all the elements.

abcd

abcd

## Images

When you want to add images by markdown,you have square brackets followed by parentheses,and we also need to put an exclamation point in front of the square brackets,then put the link of the images in the parentheses.

For example:

![This is an image](https://github.com/ShiyuFan0820/MarkdownNote.md/assets/149340606/e3893e33-1474-45f1-aad7-9e12e9584b12)

## Lists

If you want to type a list,you can use number and a period after that and a space followed by the list items.It does not matter what the number is.

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3

If you do not want the number list,you can exchange the number with "*","-",or "+".

- Item 1
- Item 2 
- Item 3

If you want to nest the list you can type the "ENTER",then put a "TAB" key or four spaces before the texts.

- Item 1
  - Item 2
    - Item 3

## Tables

The format of create a table is like this:

![](https://github.com/ShiyuFan0820/MarkdownNote.md/assets/149340606/2fcedaa9-1f2f-4fc0-b5e5-bcbef8c87128)

And the result is like this:

 | Col 1 | Col 2  |
 | ----- | ------ |
 | This  |  is    |
 | an    | example|
 | table | with   |
 | two   | columns|

**Notice:**

Divider:In between the first row and all other rows you must add a divider,and this divider will tell you that the row up it is header and the rows below are normal rows.For the dividers you should put at least three dashes.It is not matter that every row should have the same quantity of dash.

Alignment: Adding a colon to the right of the dash keeps the texts in the same column right-aligned，if you want the texts to stay left-aligned,just add the colon on the left of the dash.If you want text centered, add colons to both ends of the dash.

## Checklist

To add a checklist just put texts after the open and closed square brackets which has a space in it,and make sure at the beginning of the square brackets has a dash followed by a space,for example:

![](https://github.com/ShiyuFan0820/MarkdownNote.md/assets/149340606/6ddd6957-311e-4610-8df2-5e4a44564cf0)

- [ ] This is a checklist

If the list is checked,exchange the space in the square brackets with a "X" to show this list is completed.
